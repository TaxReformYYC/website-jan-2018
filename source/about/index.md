## Dear Calgary,

My name is Dan, I'm a Calgarian, and I'm ticked off about our property taxes.

Arguably, this is the most boring and least controversial issue ever. Nobody likes paying to live on property they already own. But this, by itself, is not the problem.

The assessment process itself is broken. I have a hunch that City administrators are unable to fix it. Though all those serving at City Hall have been extraordinarily helpful and friendly, without political will, this problem will persist.

Property taxes are frustrating, boring, and expensive for all the wrong reasons. This site chronicles my efforts to solve the problem.

I've been filing property appeals with the City of Calgary for several years. Here's what I've learned so far:

- City assessors repeat their mistakes year after year
- You need to be well prepared with hard numerical evidence in support of your position
- City bureaucrats will not tell you how they assess our homes, [because they don't have to!](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf)
              
### _Wait, what?_

That's right. As an Alberta property owner, you have no right to see how your city assesses the value of your home. You are not allowed to apply their methods to see if they made a mistake. Take a look at Section 27.3, Subsection 2 from [Matters Relating to Assessment and Taxation Regulation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf).

### _That's outrageous!_

It sure is. Email your [City Councillor](http://www.calgary.ca/citycouncil/Pages/citycouncil.aspx?redirect=/general/pages/calgary-city-council.aspx) and [MLA](http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_report&memPhoto=True&alphaboth=True&alphaindex=True&build=y&caucus=All&conoffice=True&legoffice=True&mememail=True) to protest this bizarre lack of transparency. Be sure to mention that Dan from TaxReformYYC sent you. 

### _So what am I supposed to do?_

Apart from badgering our elected officials until they fix the problem, you have no option but to file an appeal with the ARB.

Toward that end, I created a series of _how-to_ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkQAXLFkBnmiB8O06C2oGAoarBCVO7M9J) videos which walk you through the same process I use to win my own appeals. These were created for the 2017 tax season. Also, feel free to use the sample report I posted below as a launch point for your own appeal.

Alternatively, you can collect your data, send it all to [reports@taxreformyyc.com](mailto:reports@taxreformyyc.com), and let me run the numbers for you. I'm a computer programmer by trade and have automated the assessment process used by our city's Assessment Business Unit. From there you can decide if it's worth your time to launch an appeal.

[This is a sample of the kind of report](/Sample-Report-for-2016/) I have submitted as evidence. You are free to use and adapt it however you see fit!

I'm happy to answer questions and do independent property re-assessments with data collected by the City of Calgary. My approach has won me three appeals with the [Assessment Review Board](https://arb.calgary.ca/), which rules on disputes between homeowners and City Hall.

## Want my help?

Learn your home's precise discrepancy in valuation _free of charge_, though [donations](/donate) are appreciated and a great source of encouragement.

All you need to do is collect your data!

You may submit a report as evidence to the Assessment Review Board or your [councillor](http://www.calgary.ca/citycouncil/Pages/citycouncil.aspx?redirect=/general/pages/calgary-city-council.aspx).
