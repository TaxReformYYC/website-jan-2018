I applied for the [Assessment Review Board's](http://www.calgaryarb.ca/eCourtPublic/) General Chair position several months ago. They're typically looking for lawyers and real estate agents, so it was a bit of a longshot. Though I was disppointed that I didn't get the job, it was a bit of a thrill to get a PFO letter from the mayor's office. I will definitely be applying again.

Zoom in close... I think he actually signed it.
