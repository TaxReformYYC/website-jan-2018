I received my property assessment notice in the mail today. Once again, I have to appeal before Calgary's <a href="http://www.calgaryarb.ca/eCourtPublic/">Assessment Review Board</a>.

I've won three appeals. Precedent has been set and is a matter of public record.

| Year | ARB File # | Original Asmnt | Corrected Asmnt | Tax Savings |
| ---- | ---------: | -------------: | --------------: | ----------: |
| 2016 | 101313     | $616,500       | $545,000        | $441.43     |
| 2016 | 92724      | $581,000       | $527,000        | $333.39     |
| 2017 | 107885     | $562,500       | $501,165        | $398.73     |

This year I'm being assessed at $572,000. Last year the ARB _corrected_ the mistake and set it at $501,165. Why does the City keep making the same dishonest error?

This issue impacts thousands of Calgary home owners. If that's you, tell me about it: [reports@taxreformyyc.com](mailto:reports@taxreformyyc.com).

[The software that has won each of my appeals](https://github.com/TaxReformYYC/report-generator-2018) is open-source and free for everyone. Civic-minded developers, take it, make it better, and pass it on (pull requests are welcome as long as your code is tested).

Currently, it's only been deployed on Ubuntu 16.04. If you're a Mac or Windows user, see if you can get it set up. Please share your knowledge with all of Calgary.

## Donations are appreciated

I'd like to obtain copies of the audio recorded during my ARB hearings. 

If necessary, I'd also like to file a FOIP request for the property data collected by the City of Calgary. There is currently no API and home owners are limited to 50 reports per year. I will use this data to perform a public, external audit.

[Donations](/donate) are appreciated and very encouraging.
