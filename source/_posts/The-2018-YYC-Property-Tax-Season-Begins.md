I received my property assessment notice in the mail today. Once again, I have to appeal before Calgary's <a href="http://www.calgaryarb.ca/eCourtPublic/">Assessment Review Board</a>.

I've won three appeals. The precedent has been set and is as matter of public record.

| Year | ARB File # | Original Asmnt | Corrected Asmnt | Tax Savings |
| ---- | ---------: | -------------: | --------------: | ----------: |
| 2016 | 101313     | $616,500       | $545,000        | $441.43     |
| 2016 | 92724      | $581,000       | $527,000        | $333.39     |
| 2017 | 107885     | $562,500       | $501,165        | $398.73     |

This year I'm being assessed at $572,000. Last year the ARB _corrected_ the mistake and set it at $501,165. Why does the City keep making the same dishonest error?

This issue impacts thousands of Calgary home owners. If that's you, tell me about it: [reports@taxreformyyc.com](mailto:reports@taxreformyyc.com).

I'm open-sourcing [the software that has won each of my appeals](https://github.com/TaxReformYYC/report-generator-2018).

It's a work in progress and developer focussed, but I'm here to help.
