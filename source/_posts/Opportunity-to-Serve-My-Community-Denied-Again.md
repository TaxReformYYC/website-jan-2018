Another letter from Naheed!

Unlike my [previous attempt](/2017/03/28/A-Groovy-Letter-from-a-Gnarly-Mayor/) at drawing attention to systemic problems at City Hall, I was surprised by this rejection. The letter below is in response to an application I made to sit on the [Innovate Calgary](https://www.innovatecalgary.com/) board as a _Member at Large_. This seems about as entry-level as it can get when it comes to serving on City boards. 

I guess no one on Council wants to hear me droning on about government accountability and open data.
