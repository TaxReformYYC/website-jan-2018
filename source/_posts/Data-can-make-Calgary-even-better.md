Thank you, Ward, for hearing my issue. This is what I'll be asking of you at our meeting on Monday. I'll be as concise as possible.

## Here's what I know:

According to the city, [this is how my property is assessed](http://www.calgary.ca/CA/city-manager/Pages/Our-Finances/Taxes/OurFinance-property-tax-questions.aspx#q2). There aren't a lot of details. The final line in the section is a matter of special concern:

> Your assessed property value goes through internal checks and balances and a provincial audit before the notice is mailed to you in early January.

There's a problem with these internal checks and balances.

## Here's how I know:

My own property assessments for the past three years are what tipped me off.

- 2015 - $536,500 (lost appeal, purchase price of $520,000 within margin of error)
- 2016 - $581,000 (won appeal, reduced to $527,000)
- 2017 - $562,500 (pending appeal)

So far I've won two appeals before the Assessment Review Board (for myself and a friend). If I could bring more appeals, I suspect those would win as well because city assessors will not account for their methodology.

## Here's what I did:

In 2016 I started collecting as many city property tax reports as I could. Collecting and storing these reports is a time-consuming task. It is also difficult because Calgary home owners are limited to viewing 50 reports per year. For 2016, I managed to collect {% asset_link 2016_assessed_differences.csv 212 %}. For 2017, only {% asset_link 2017_assessed_differences.csv 111 %} so far.

I performed some basic data analysis [on myself and my neighbours](/2017/02/02/YYC-Property-Tax-Secrets-Councillor-Ward-Sutherland/) and found that my house is assessed much higher than the average. This could mean that my home has some unique characteristic that makes it a much more valuable property. It could also mean city assessors made a mistake. Even supposing city assessors are correct in their valuation, without knowing what makes my home so exceptional, I cannot modify my property to make taxes more affordable.

In any case, the city representatives would not account for their methodology before the ARB, which is why I suspect I won my appeals.

### As it turns out...

My home is not the only house out of line with its neighbours. The ARB said that my first appeal was rejected because the city assessment fell within a 5% margin of error. If that is the threshold, then about 1 in 5 homes in the data I've collected is way out of line (cf. the links to the CSV files above provide precise discrepancies).

If the assessments are correct, these homeowners should be equipped to optimize their properties for tax purposes. If they're in error, they should be fixed.

## Here's what I need:

Though the [provincial legislation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf) that enables this lack of transparency should be fixed, I think City Hall will be far more responsive if I simply shine light on the problem.

I want to analyze every residential property in the City of Calgary.

### May I have all the property tax data?

I'm not asking for myself. I believe all Calgarians should have access to the data collected on our behalf and at our expense. Even with the data, I have a big organizational task ahead of me. I hope to rally fellow high-tech Calgarians to assist and have their say.

## So why's my approach so great?

It's simple, for one. I take a property's total lot size and developed square footage and plot it against the city's assessed value. A best-fit trend line shows how far individual homes deviate from the average. It's a simple and accessible approach which I demonstrate [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCglmA5G5jSJK3OQrpFB5AJw) (of course, my process is automated). In light of the bizarre secrecy surrounding the city's broken assessment methodology, I believe this approach is also the best foundation upon which to launch an appeal with the ARB.

My treatment of the property data collected by the city is [self-explanatory and on full display](/Sample-Report-for-2016/). The methodology I apply is simple and fair.

If there are shortcomings in my approach, I am open to criticism.

The City of Calgary cannot say the same.

### An example

The home plotted on this chart is in our neighbourhood so it is easy to visit in person. This is one of the worst assessment errors I've found so far this year.

{% asset_img 50_rockyledge_ri_nw.png "50 Rockyledge Ri NW" %}

By my math, the home represented by the red dot is overassessed by $172,215.22. That is a discrepancy of 21.68%. People keep saying that _math is hard_. I say that's why we have computers!

### Interesting note:

Ultimately the evidence suggests that my assessment approach is basically identical to that of the city. Here's a chart produced with actual data from some homes nearby. Remember, I simply calculate total lot sizes and developed square footage and plot it all against assessed values.

{% asset_img 20_rockyvalley_vi_nw.png "20 Rockyvalley Vi NW" %}

Each house is right on the line, as it should be. What causes the variation in the previous chart? Without knowing, Calgarians simply do not have the opportunity to lower their property taxes by adjusting their homes and lifestyles. 

# Thank you

Ward, I appreciate the time you devoted to this matter. I know I am asking a lot, but it is for nothing more than what already belongs to me and all Calgarians. Please help me obtain _all_ the residential assessment data for 2017 so that we may all learn the extent of Calgary's property assessment problems.
