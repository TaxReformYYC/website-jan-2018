Thank you for your quick consideration of my request for data for my proof-of-concept [property tax audit process](https://taxreformyyc.com/audit). In the four years I've been pursuing this matter, your co-labourers at City Hall have been courteous in performing within the parameters to which they're bound. Thank you for your dutiful service.

I am also acting in service to my community, Calgary, the city in which I was born and raised. A little over four years ago I discovered an error in the administration and methodologies adopted by the Assessment Business Unit. I've talked about the problem to death on this blog. It is well documented here and in the public record. As it turns out, I lost my last appeal because the [Assessment Review Board](http://www.calgaryarb.ca/eCourtPublic/) believes the best way to resolve this issue is through judicial review. They may be right, but I have no desire to go that route.

The bigger problem is that the ABU's errors have city-wide impact. Moreover, the ABU have been unable or unwilling to correct their errors. As you can see from my [audit map](https://taxreformyyc.com/audit), there are several irregularities which my neighbours should appeal. Click on one of the red dollar signs and [download a free assessment report](https://taxreformyyc.com/report/11315_ROCKYVALLEY_DR_NW.pdf). This report is automatically generated with the data I'm requesting from you. These reports are the same as the ones that brought me three victories before the ARB. I would not be a good neighbour if I were to remain silent on this issue. Read through my blog. You will discover a genuine and persistant act of community service.

In addition to helping my neighbours, I want to alert our elected representatives to the scope of the problem. A nice map with all the problem-areas highlighted is a far more effective tool than a discussion about raw numbers. This will also enable our politicians and new candidates to locate the citizens with whom they should speak first.

### Now, concerning your phone call...

My current audit process depends upon the PDF reports meted out at [assessmentsearch.calgary.ca](http://assessmentsearch.calgary.ca). Of course, I'm no stranger to handling data, so it's really just a question of what is easiest and fastest for you. Will you export your database to thumbdrive? Will you download the PDF reports for me? Will you provide an open API so that all Calgarians can explore this matter for themselves?

I am confident my current process can handle the roughly 2,000 property reports I require to audit my entire neighbourhood. Though I can't promise anything this year, I will eventually audit the entire city. Once the kinks are worked out, this would mean the difference between generating property assessments in minutes instead of days.

Minimally, I require all the property reports for Rocky Ridge for this year. I will also require these reports for the 2019 tax season. A year-over-year comparison will shed even more light on our problem.

Though writing civic software has become a bit of a hobby, it's not something I want to pursue forever, because ultimately this is all a terrible waste of my time and money. Thank you for your offer of helping me acquire the data I need to build my community and hold my government to account. Your quick consideration of this matter is appreciated.

Peace,

Dan 

P.s., who is the most senior labourer in the ABU? If this matter goes to judicial review, it would not be fair or appropriate to have a subordinate face me at this year's appeal with the ARB.
