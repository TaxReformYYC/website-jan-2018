Though I've submitted evidence for many appeals, today was my first time attending a hearing. Like many Calgarians, my friends Nathan and Lauren were faced with the daunting task of challenging the assessment of our inscrutable, opaque, property assessment bureaucracy. And when I say _opaque_ I mean _opaque_. The representative for the city admitted on record that the methods they use to arrive at your property assessment are not divulged to the people who pay their salaries. [That should make you really mad](http://www.calgary.ca/citycouncil/Pages/citycouncil.aspx?redirect=/general/pages/calgary-city-council.aspx).

In any case, here's a rundown of what happens during one of these hearings. Hopefully it will help you ease your nerves and successfully appeal your own property tax assessment...

# Location

Nathan and Lauren's appeal took place on the 4th Floor of the DJ3 Building on 1212 - 31 Avenue NE. It's a surprisingly friendly place. Me and a family from Varsity arrived early and waited in Boardroom 5, which was set up like a mini courtroom, complete with a gavel and Bible. 

Like in a courtroom, there are seperate tables for the _prosecution_ and _defence_. That's a rough analogy, of course, because no one was being prosecuted. Both me and the city representative were there to defend our respective property analyses. 

One thing I found jarring about the whole scene was the the fluorescent _Recording_ sign. Every word you speak during one of these hearings is recorded, even before the meeting is called to order. Jarring though it was, it's also comforting to know that everyone had better have their stories straight, or they'd get called on it later.

# The People

There was a panel of three reviewers, myself, the city representative, and those waiting in line behind me. Those waiting in line got the benefit of seeing how the process works before they were subjected to it. On the other hand, they had to wait through the most boring courtroom drama imaginable: i.e., a dispute over property taxes.

# The Process

Everyone was amazingly helpful (even the lady from the city). The head reviewer outlined the process before we got started. As I recall, it went roughly like this:

## Round 1

1. I presented the evidence I collected in support of my appeal
2. The city representative then asked me questions about the evidence I brought to the hearing
3. The review panel took their turn asking questions about my evidence. They also followed up with their own questions concerning the questions raised by the city
4. As this is a fairly informal setting, back-and-forth questioning was permitted

## Round 2

1. The city presented the evidence they collected in defence of their assessment
2. I then asked questions about the city's evidence
3. As before, the reviewers asked the city their own questions and followed up on anything that came to mind as a result of my own questions
4. A little more back-and-forth question-and-answering

## Final Round

1. I'm allowed to summarize my appeal in light of my own evidence, that submitted by the city, and the question-answer discussion that took place over the course of the hour
2. The city summarizes their position in a similar fashion

## A Final Surprise Twist!

1. The head reviewer allowed me to give a final word...

As a newbie at hearings, this was an unexpected and very welcome opportunity. Nathan and Lauren's appeal went well. The evidence I submitted was rock-solid, and best of all, totally transparent. The city representative was getting pretty flustered by the end, especially because she couldn't answer basic questions about how they arrive at their numbers (their assessment methodology is secret, remember). And though the hearing went well, I went on the defensive with these final words:

### _How can anyone launch an effective appeal if the city keeps its assessment methods secret?_

When the city representative asked to respond to that question, the head reviewer said "No, he has the final word". 

We're expecting the decision within thirty days. I'm hopeful that it will be rendered in Nathan and Lauren's favour. Until then, I hope this procedural overview is helpful to other overtaxed Calgarians who are paying more than their fair share.

As an added bonus, I heard the reviewers whispering as I walked away... _He called the whole process into question_.

I wonder if it was picked up by the mics.
