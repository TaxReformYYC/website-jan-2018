File 121620... the ARB decided against me!

I'd be choked, but this does open the possibility for a Judicial Review before the Court of Queen's Bench. As a side benefit, this necessitates notifying my MLA, Sandra Jansen, of the application. I still haven't received a response from my [inquiry last August](2017/08/10/MLA-Sandra-Jansen-Provincial-Law-Undermines-Bureaucratic-Accountability/).

At this point, I'm not 100% certain I am going to apply for review. People normally hire lawyers for this kind of thing. I don't have money for that.

This post will evolve over time. For now, I'm simply documenting how far I get in the Judicial Review process.

## Applying for Judicial Review before the Court of Queen's Bench

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't really know for what I'm Googling. Here are a couple of resources I've found useful so far:

- https://raeandcompany.com/a-quick-guide-to-judicial-review/
- http://www.aclrc.com/appealing-from-tribunal-decisions/

Both are Calgary-based and both lead me to believe I may be able to obtain a review. In my case, I have 60 days to _give notice of application_ to the relevant parties.

##  Prerogative Writs

The sources above suggest _Certiorari_. I don't know what that is, but here it means the Court may set aside a decision, or refer it back to the relevant tribunal for reconsideration.

This sounds like my best bet, if I go forward.

## Standard of Review

Was the ARB's decision _reasonable_ OR _correct_? Pick one or the other. You can't have both, though I think I can present my evidence both ways.

The ARB's decision seems tailor-made to invite a correctness review... 

## How do I apply for review?

That's what I'm trying to figure out.

[Form 30](https://albertacourts.ca/qb/areas-of-law/civil/forms), courtesy of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, seems relevant, but my browser won't open their PDF for some reason.

The [Support in Preparing Court Forms](https://www.alberta.ca/support-preparing-court-forms.aspx) page directed me to call the Calgary Courts Centre. I left a message inquiring after the proper forms on Tuesday, June 12. I'll report back when I hear from them.

## Proactive data collection

I email-ordered an audio transcript of my ARB hearing on Wednesday, June 13. It's going to cost me $50.

## What's next?

I'm really not sure yet. Court seems like a waste of time and energy and I've got no money for a lawyer. On the other hand, I don't want to have to keep doing this year after year. 

Stay tuned as I navigate strange new bureaucracies...
