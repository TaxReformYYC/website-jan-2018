Assessment Review day finally arrived! I filed an appeal in March and was allowed the privilege of getting some answers from the City's assessors.

It turns out, they don't have to answer certain questions... by law.

This is the second time a City assessor has admitted in recorded session that they don't have to reveal their assessment methodology to tax payers. The [first time](/2016/08/25/Calgary-Assessment-Review-Board-Hearing-Process/) the assessor didn't cite the law, which says this:

```
(2) Despite subsection (1), information that is required to be
provided under section 299 or 300 of the Act does not include
coefficients. 
```

That's Section 27.3, Subsection 2 from [Matters Relating to Assessment and Taxation Regulation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf). 

So how did this come up?

Basically, they City insists we've performed some minor renovations on our home. We have not performed any renovations. They evidence they provided came from the MLS listing that led us to purchase our home in 2014. Toward this end, two questions arose:

1. How long does the City have to factor minor renovations into the assessed value
2. How much do minor renovations impact the assessed value

The City assessor did not know the answer to the first question. When pressed on the second, she said she doesn't have to answer because of the law cited above.
