## Howdy, Ward!

I'll cut right to the chase...

### I want to know how my residential property assessment is calculated.

I've asked the city, but they say they don't have to tell me. This seems crazy, because politicians like yourself are always promising transparent and accountable government.

Now, I must confess that it really rustles my jimmies when people do shady things with money. So when a city bureaucrat tells me that I'm not allowed to know how my home is assessed, I start to become suspicious. They tell me to read _Section 27.3, Subsection 2_ of [Matters Relating to Assessment and Taxation Regulation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf). That's a provincial law, so I'm guessing the secrecy is province wide.

As a successful city councillor and community leader, I'm sure you have already recognized the opportunity this presents to yourself. It is an election year after all, and this is low-hanging fruit. I think Ward 1 voters would like to know what you're going to do to shine some light onto the shade. I can't speak for everyone in our community, but I know you and I are aligned in our expectation of transparent, open city government.

### Now that you're aware of the problem, here's how I can help...

My family purchased a home in Rocky Ridge for $520,000 in 2014. City assessors valued our property at $534,000. I appealed - assuming that this was a simple matter to resolve - and lost.

The very next year, my assessment spiked to $581,000. Take a look at the chart below. The dots are all the houses on my street. My house is colored red.

I showed the ARB that chart last year and they reduced my assessment to $527,000. Still a little over-assessed, but I was very happy with the $700 my family saved that year in property taxes.

Imagine my surprise when my assessment spiked once again to $562,500!

I've been looking at homes all around our neighbourhood. There are a lot of families that aren't being assessed fairly.

With that in mind, I've created a series of [free YouTube tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMKr_3_2BSA&list=PLkQAXLFkBnmiB8O06C2oGAoarBCVO7M9J) that show Calgary home owners how to prepare the same kind of winning appeal. Will you pass this message along to our neighbours? My hope is that if we all shine enough light onto this shady situation, the problem will get fixed. I hate dealing with property taxes. I know you'll help me put [TaxReformYYC](https://www.facebook.com/taxreformyyc/) out of business by working to make the assessment process fair and transparent.

### First things first though...

I want to know how my home is assessed, and I'm sure you're now curious too.

Sincerely,

Daniel Bidulock

P.s., Your kind of work is stressful and often thankless. So let me say _thank you_ for your service to our community. I hope to work with you in the coming years.
