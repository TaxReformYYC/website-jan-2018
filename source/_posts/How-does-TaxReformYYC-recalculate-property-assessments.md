Here's an email from another frustrated Calgarian:

> I tried appealing last year. I thought my house was assessed too high, but the ARB explained to me that we have the largest amount of developed space and that our taxes weren't the highest at the time. We also have a private entrance facing two parks, which raises the value.

## Howdy Greg!
    
It sounds like your situation is just as frustrating as mine. I moved my family into Rocky Ridge two years ago. When we received our assessment notice the first year, our property was valued at $16,500 more than what we actually paid. I figured this was no big deal. Maybe it was just an administrative error.

The ARB performed a reassessment, _agreed_ with my conclusions, and then denied my appeal!

This was frustrating enough. Imagine my surprise when this year's assessment arrived and I learned that my house is now worth even more... $44,500 more, to be precise. 

So this year, instead of appealing to common sense (e.g., concerning plummeting oil prices, a sputtering economy, sliding home values, etc.), I started crunching numbers and created an assessment similar to this [Sample Report](/Sample-Report-for-2016).

All the good stuff is shown in the chart. Though the addresses are fake, that's real data. The circles are my neighbours and the red dot is my house. The exact method by which I arrived at those numbers is presented in the report itself. I aim to be fully transparent in my approach so that city assessors have nothing to dispute.

Over all, this is how I reassess a property:

1. I collect my data and that of my neighbours at [assessmentsearch.calgary.ca](http://assessmentsearch.calgary.ca).
2. I remove all the features that my property has in common with all my neighbours (if we all have attached garages, for example, we should all be assessed the same for that particular feature).
3. I identify and remove all unknown factors. That is, if one house was built in 2002 and another in 2003, the newer one might be assessed higher, but I can't say how much. Until the city reveals exactly how these unknown factors impact a property's value, there's no way we can accurately determine the final value on our own. Make no mistake... this is totally unfair and makes it impossible to launch a fully effective appeal.
4. I make a scatter plot with a _best fit_ line right up the middle. The line is kind of like an average. The circles are houses. The further the circle is from the line, the bigger the disparity between you and your neighbours. You can see from the sample report why I am so mad about my taxes this year.
5. Finally, to determine the corrected assessment value, I calculate the distance of the circle from that blue line. You got a flyer taped to your door because your house is at least 5% overassessed. Any less than that, I wouldn't have bothered.

The more things you have in common with the houses being compared, the easier it is to appeal your assessment. My house and lot are very similar to my neighbours, so if I don't win my appeal, my City Councillor (Ward Sutherland) is going to hear all about it.

This is all just simple data analysis. It compares property lot sizes and total developed area against the assessed values. Those are the only values ordinary Calgarians can quantify in any meaningful way. The city doesn't divulge exactly how much a fireplace impacts an assessment (for example), nor does it say exactly how much living next to two parks with a private entrance drives up your valuation.

Incidentally, there's something you might like on the [TaxReformYYC Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/taxreformyyc/) page...

The biggest house on the street is the one with the lowest assessment. That doesn't make any sense. It's also next to some beautiful parkland and directly across from a pond. Be sure to Like, follow, and share with your friends.

Let me clarify: this house is not _under_-assessed, every other house on the street is _over_-assessed. I certainly wouldn't wish higher taxes upon anyone.

If you decide to appeal your assessment, I will generate a report for you to submit as evidence to the Assessment Review Board. I will also provide the consolidated data used as the basis for the report. I am confident in my method and am using it myself in my own appeal. It's fully transparent and, I dare say, very difficult to dispute, especially in light of all the data the City doesn't want to share. That said, I cannot guarantee what the ARB will do. If they deny your appeal, do what I did and badger your City Councillor for some answers. I'm getting to know mine better all the time.
