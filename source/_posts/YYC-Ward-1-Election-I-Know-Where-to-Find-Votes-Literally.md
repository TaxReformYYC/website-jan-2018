## Coral, Cole, Chris, and Ward... Howdy!

My name is Dan. My background is in Artificial Intelligence (M.Sc., 2012). I want to use _big data_ to change things up on Council and at City Hall. Newcomers, I've got a goldmine of campaign material for you on this site and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/taxreformyyc/).

Three years ago I moved into Rocky Ridge. Right from the get-go the City of Calgary has been overassessing my property. No big deal, right? File an appeal, present your evidence, problem solved. Sadly, this has not been the case. I've appeared before the [Assessment Review Board](http://www.calgaryarb.ca/eCourtPublic/) three times now. I've won every time: 

| Year | ARB File # | Original Asmnt | Corrected Asmnt | Tax Savings  |
| ---- | ---------: | -------------: | --------------: | -----------: |
| 2016 | 101313     | $616,500       | $545,000        | $441.43      |
| 2016 | 92724      | $581,000       | $527,000        | $333.39      |
| 2017 | 107885     | $562,500       | $501,165        | $398.73      |

The problem is, even with three independent quasi-judicial rulings in my favour, City assessors keep making the same mistakes.

### So what?

I'm a computer programmer by trade. I wrote a nifty little program that processes data collected by the City and automatically generates [reports like this](/Sample-Report-for-2016/). As you can see, my approach is transparent and my reporting self explanatory... most importantly, the ARB likes them. Three victories is just the beginning, because I fully expect to be hauled back again next year.

Naturally, I'm not too happy about this. I've been analyzing my neighbours' homes here in Ward 1 to learn the extent of the problem. Of the 67 relevant [property reports](https://assessmentsearch.calgary.ca) I managed to collect in 2017 (the City limits home owners to 50 reports per year), these are the ones that have fallen victim to the City's flawed assessment methodology beyond the _acceptable_ 5% margin of error:

| Ward 1 Address          | 2017 Asmnt | Corrected | Overpaid 2017 |
| ----------------------- | ---------: | --------: | ------------: |
| 42 Rockyledge Ri NW     | $616,000   | $580,971  | $227.72       |  
| 50 Rockyledge Ri NW     | $794,500   | $622,284  | $1,119.54     |
| 62 Rockyledge Ri NW     | $579,500   | $549,502  | $195.01       |
| 74 Rockyledge Ri NW     | $545,000   | $517,258  | $180.35       |
| 11315 Rockyvalley Dr NW | $558,500   | $508,785  | $323.19       |
| 11347 Rockyvalley Dr NW | $562,500   | $497,885  | $420.05       |
| 11429 Rockyvalley Dr NW | $549,000   | $513,649  | $229.81       |
| 2 Royal Oak Cape NW     | $639,500   | $590,969  | $315.49       |
| 4 Royal Oak Cape NW     | $645,500   | $597,320  | $313.21       |
| 8 Royal Oak Cape NW     | $683,500   | $597,193  | $561.06       |
| 12 Royal Oak Cape NW    | $702,000   | $621,726  | $521.85       |
| 16 Royal Oak Cape NW    | $650,500   | $597,912  | $341.86       |
| 20 Royal Oak Cape NW    | $691,500   | $612,095  | $516.20       |
| 28 Royal Oak Cape NW    | $691,500   | $651,721  | $258.60       |
| 24 Royal Oak Cape NW    | $706,500   | $619,038  | $568.57       |

So, from my limited sample, 15 of the 67 properties analyzed (or 22.4%) would save a boat load of cash if the City was assessing their homes in a fair and equitable manner.

I want to perform the same analysis for every home in Calgary, but the City is stingy with the data they collect on our behalf and at our expense.

#### The people living at the addresses listed above need capable representation on Council. I know I'd vote for someone who could save me $1,119.54 per year.

In case you're curious, here's a visualization of how _50 Rockyledge Ri NW_ compares against neighbouring properties:

This graph is produced with data provided by the City of Calgary. Call them up and ask them why that one house is so out of whack. You may be surprised to learn [they don't have to tell you](/2016/09/16/Calgarians-aren-t-allowed-to-calculate-their-own-property-taxes/).

### I want to help

Going door-to-door must be a real drag. You could save time and be more impactful with some highly targeted campaigning. If your volunteers will collect some data, I'll tell you the houses you need to visit. Personalized campaign brochures targeted to specific households are a real possibility.

### To the newcomers:

[Coral Taylor](http://votecoral.ca/), [Cole Christensen](http://votecole.ca/), and [Chris Blatch](http://www.blatchward1.ca/)...

I've reached out to [Ward Sutherland](http://www.wardsutherland.com) a dozen times over the last two years. He's not interested, but the Calgarians being fleeced by City Hall definitely are. I don't know the people, but I do know where they live. They would love to hear your thoughts on open data, [bureaucratic accountability](/2017/08/10/MLA-Sandra-Jansen-Provincial-Law-Undermines-Bureaucratic-Accountability/), and saving real money.

#### Sincerely,

#### Daniel Bidulock, your Ward 1 neighbour
