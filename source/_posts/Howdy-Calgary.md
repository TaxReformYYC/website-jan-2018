## Fellow Calgarian,

### Do you know how to calculate your property taxes?

#### Me neither...

It should be easy.

Regrettably, the methods by which your property's value is assessed are difficult and obscure.

Just ask any Calgary real estate agent.

### You might be paying more than your fair share

Independent data analysis reveals that the assessments levied against Calgary homeowners often appear arbitrary.

There is little bearing between what you pay in taxes and the size of your home and lot.

### There's a good chance that your assessment is too high

## _How can I tell?_

### [Find out what your neighbours are paying](https://assessmentsearch.calgary.ca/)
      
You might have a neighbour with a bigger house and yard.

Is that neighbour's assessment higher or lower?

If it's lower, you're taxes are probably too high.

## _How do I appeal?_

### [Pay your filing fee **before March 7, 2016**](https://arb.calgary.ca/eCourtPublicCarb/)

It is important that your appeal be filed on time. You'll have the opportunity to present your evidence later. Just make sure you file before March 7.

Once the Review Board receives notice of your complaint, there will be a period during which they examine the evidence you later submit and compare it against the city's assessment.

If they decide your complaint has merit, your assessed value will be reduced and you will pay less in property taxes.

## _How do they decide if my appeal has merit?_

### Good question.

The [City of Calgary](http://calgary.ca) doesn't make it easy to hold their assessors to account.

Their assessment methodology is an opaque process that is difficult and time consuming to successfully appeal. 

To make matters worse, you can't effectivley challenge their assessment methodology without knowing the methodology.

## _So what can I do?_

### Be prepared!

Numbers don't lie.

Having a concise visualization of your assessment data as compared against your neighbours' will greatly aid your appeal.

## _Shouldn't you be able to see how your taxes are calculated for yourself?_

### Yes!

Good government is transparent government.

The City of Calgary is taking great strides toward offering citizens [open access](https://data.calgary.ca/) to the data it collects and generates.

### Strangely, the public is not allowed full access to property tax data

[Contact your councillor](http://www.calgary.ca/citycouncil/Pages/citycouncil.aspx?redirect=/general/pages/calgary-city-council.aspx#council) and ask why Calgarians don't have full access to their property assessment data.

It's your data. You should have full access.

## _How could the city mess up my assessment?_

### One can only wonder...

Assessment errors are almost certainly due to human error.

A better question would be, _Why are we paying humans to do the work of machines?_

Again, this question is best posed to [your councillor](http://www.calgary.ca/citycouncil/Pages/citycouncil.aspx?redirect=/general/pages/calgary-city-council.aspx#council).
