Ward, please allow me to apologize for being short with you. You deserve better, and you will receive better from me. It is regrettable that after these two years, our first contact would be marred by such hostility. I hope there is opportunity for reconciliation and partnership between us.

You know that I have been very patient and persistent in trying to get your attention. I have made offers of assistance. I have reached out to you many times. I've even compiled free resources to help my community appeal their property taxes.

I was disappointed in how you finally chose to respond.

Allow me one last offer to work with you.

The issue I bring forward is one that affects thousands of Calgarians and Albertans. I suspect 10-20% of homes are unfairly assessed. This needs to be fixed. Calgary needs your help.

Yes, our city bureaucrats are protected by provincial law. Yes, these laws are a provincial matter. This is not a small issue. In order to be fixed, there needs to be grassroots momentum (me) backed by influential representatives (you).

I am trying to draw attention to an issue I can only demonstrate on a small scale. My numbers show about 1 in 5 Rocky Ridge homes are unfairly assessed. I can't know for sure without free access to our property tax data. Even if you can't help with the province, city data is something to which both you and I should have free access. Calgarians pay for it. Let us see it. It is my understanding that Edmonton gives unlimited access to the same data. Why doesn't Calgary do the same?

Our Property Tax department is broken. My last three assessments are evidence enough. Will you please help me fix the problem for myself and all Calgarians?

Sincerely,

Daniel Bidulock
