## Howdy Sandra!

My issue relates to municipal property taxes, but this is largely a provincial matter...

Let me draw your attention to Section 27.3, Subsection 2 of [The Municipal Government Act - Matters Relating to Assessment and Taxation Regulation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf).

The section cited above pertains to the coefficients employed in assessing a property's value. Simply put, city assessors in Alberta don't have to tell property owners how they actually crunch the numbers that decide how much tax they pay.

In practical terms, this makes it difficult to launch an effective appeal before the quasi-judicial boards that rule on these matters. In Calgary, this board is called the [Assessment Review Board](http://www.calgaryarb.ca). Though difficult, I've had two successful appeals. I'm still waiting (69 days and counting) for their decision on my latest.

The root of the problem is this: when City of Calgary assessors are confronted with the [hard numerical evidence](/Sample-Report-for-2016/) demonstrating that their assessment methodology is flawed, they hide behind the subsection in the act named above. They cannot be held to account.

This problematic provincial law has created a situation wherein giving our civil servants _the benefit of the doubt_ means assuming incompetence over corruption. It's unflattering from any angle elevated by common sense.

Please take the time to browse my site [taxreformyyc.com](https://taxreformyyc.com/). You'll see most of my efforts to draw attention to this problem. Also, my appeal hearings are a matter of public record, so if any of this seems too ridiculous to be true, let the audio recordings remove any doubt.

This law doesn't need to be _fixed_, it needs to be removed completely. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.

Sincerely,

Daniel Bidulock
