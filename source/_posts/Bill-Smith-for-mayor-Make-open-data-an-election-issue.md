## Howdy Bill!

One of your campaign volunteers left a message on my phone the other day. Incredibly, this has never happened before, so I was intrigued enough to Google your name. This lead me to your [campaign site](http://www.billsmithformayor.ca/).

One plank in your platform - _lower taxes_ - rings true:

> The City of Calgary’s out of control spending and budgeting problems mean Calgarians have seen their property taxes increase by over 51 per cent in the past seven years.

> The City needs to cut unnecessary spending, streamline operations, maximize efficiencies and stop paying millions of dollars to consultants for more studies.

> It’s time for a common sense approach.

It just so happens that I have a sure-fire way to _cut unnecessary spending_, _streamline operations_ and literally shrink the size of our government by at least 73 people. Why 73 people? Because there were 73 signatures on the evidence package submitted by the City to the Assessment Review Board, which hears property tax appeals.

73 City Hall employees are doing work that could have easily been automated by computers 30 years ago.

## As you said, _it's time for a common sense approach_.

So how is it that an entire arm of our city bureaucracy persists in spite of common sense? Two reasons:

### 1. City assessors do not have to account for their methods.

Their practices are secret and that secrecy is protected by [provincial law](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2004_220.pdf). This is a province-wide problem. Albertans cannot apply the same methods employed by those who assess their properties. It is incredible that anyone could be expected to launch an effective property tax appeal if we cannot even determine how the City arrives at the numbers that they do.

### 2. City Hall does not freely share the data collected and paid for by Calgarians.

As a homeowner, I am limited to 50 property reports a year. It is my understanding that Edmonton shares this data freely. Why not Calgary?

## Let's see the data!

I'm a professional programmer. It took me a day and a half to write software that automatically generates reports like [these](/Sample-Report-for-2016/). I've won two appeals so far and am currently waiting for the ARB to decide on my third (they're 37 days overdue on that decision, FYI).

All this to say, if I had free access to the data bought and paid for by Calgarians, I could produce the same reports for every single home in the city. I want to track down errors like these:

{% asset_img 50_rockyledge_ri_nw.png "50 Rockyledge Ri NW" %}

The homes plotted on this chart are in my neighbourhood. The home represented by the red dot is overassessed by $172,215.22. This is one of the worst assessment errors I've found so far this year. That is a discrepancy of 21.68%. Our politicians keep saying that _math is hard_. I say that's why we have computers!

By my calculations, if the data is properly organized, it would take my dusty old desktop less than 48 hours to complete this task for every home in Calgary. I am convinced, as I hope you are too, that open data will inevitably lead to smaller, more efficient government. Open data naturally demands accountability from our bureaucrats, which currently does not exist. This is wrong. It is a political problem. It needs to be fixed.

All the best to you and your family in this coming election. My vote will go to the candidate who wants the same things I do:

- Open data,
- Small government,
- And accountability.

If that's you, I'm happy to chat about this issue any time you like.

Sincerely,

Daniel Bidulock
