After all these years, the Assessment Business Unit finally corrected the assessment error on my property. All it took was a bunch of wins before the Assessment Review Board and the threat of a judicial review, but they finally did it!

### Too bad they missed a bunch of my neighbours...

## Check your property!

### WARNING: this is beta software

Some of the red dollar signs shouldn't be red. Some houses don't know their neighbours. But given that assessments were mailed last week, I couldn't wait to give my neighbours the opportunity to try my app.

### Remember, this is an early version. The data still needs to be massaged a bit.

Once the kinks are worked out, you'll be able to download a free PDF report to use as evidence in your own appeal.

## If you have questions, find an error, or need help filing your appeal, email me at reports@taxreformyyc.com.

P.s., you can help by tracing your house on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
